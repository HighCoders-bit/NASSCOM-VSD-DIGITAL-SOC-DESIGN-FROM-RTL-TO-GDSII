  ### Arduino Board 
  This is an arduino microcontroller board. The encircled area shows the chip(microprocessor) which is interfaced with other components of the board. The designing of this chip from abstract level all the way down to the fabrication is done by RTL to GDSll flow.Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
  ### RISC-V SOC

 It consist of SRAM,SOC,ADC,DAC,SPI these all are called foundary IP's.All devices depends upon foundary where all chips are fabricated using deposition and lithography techniques and so on.

### Microcontroller Board Components
#### Core:

Definition: The central processing unit (CPU) of the microcontroller that executes instructions.
Example: ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V core.
Die:

Definition: The physical silicon chip on which the microcontrollerâ€™s circuitry is fabricated.
#### Pad:

Definition: The physical connection points on the microcontroller chip where external components are connected.
#### GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output):

Definition: Pins on the microcontroller that can be programmed to either input signals (e.g., sensors) or output signals (e.g., LEDs).
#### Bank:

Definition: A grouping of I/O pins or memory segments used for organization within the microcontroller. For GPIO, it refers to a set of pins grouped together.
#### Foundries:

Definition: Facilities where the microcontroller chips are manufactured. Examples include TSMC, Intel.
#### IPs (Intellectual Properties):

Definition: Pre-designed blocks of logic that can be integrated into the microcontroller. Examples include UART, SPI, and I2C controllers.
#### SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory):

Definition: A type of volatile memory used for temporary data storage within the microcontroller. Fast but more expensive and power-consuming than DRAM.
#### DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory):

Definition: A type of volatile memory used for larger, temporary data storage. Requires periodic refreshing to maintain data.
#### ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):

Definition: Converts analog signals (e.g., sensor outputs) into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller.
#### DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter):

Definition: Converts digital values into analog signals (e.g., to drive speakers or analog displays).
#### RISC-V SoC (System on Chip):

Definition: A microcontroller or microprocessor incorporating a RISC-V core along with additional integrated components such as memory, peripherals, and communication interfaces.
#### Macros:

Definition: Predefined sequences of code or hardware configurations used to simplify and automate repetitive tasks in programming or hardware design.
#### Connecting All Components
Core: Executes instructions and processes data.
Die: Houses the core and other integrated components.
Pad: Connects the die to external components via GPIO.
GPIO: Interfaces with external devices, configured via macros.
Bank: Organizes GPIO and other resources.
Foundries: Manufacture the microcontroller with the integrated core, SRAM, DRAM, ADC, DAC, and IPs.
IPs: Provide specialized functions like UART and SPI, integrated into the SoC.
SRAM & DRAM: Store data temporarily for processing and operation.
ADC & DAC: Enable analog signal processing and generation.
This layout ensures a microcontroller can interact with the external world and perform complex tasks by integrating various components into a single, functional chip.
