### Visualizing a RISC-V CPU Core: From Code to Silicon Layout
RISC-V Assembly Code (Left): We start with a snippet of assembly code written for the RISC-V architecture. Each line represents a low-level instruction, demonstrating the fundamental operations the CPU is designed to execute.
Implementation in Hardware Description Language (Bottom): This section displays the implementation of the picorv32 CPU core using a Hardware Description Language (likely Verilog or SystemVerilog). It demonstrates how the assembly instructions are translated into logical operations and register transfers within the CPU's architecture. Parameters for configuring the core's features (like enabling counters or cache) are also visible.
Physical Layout (Right): This represents the actual physical layout of the picorv32 CPU core, visualized using a tool like "qflow." Different colors and labels represent various circuit elements like logic gates (AND2X2, BUFX2), flip-flops (DFFPOSx1), and interconnections. This layout dictates how the transistors and wires are arranged on the silicon die to implement the CPU's functionality. Key Takeaways: The image illustrates the intricate link between software and hardware in CPU design. Starting from high-level code, we traverse down to the physical realization of a RISC-V core, showcasing the different levels of abstraction involved. This visual representation helps in understanding how CPU design choices in the hardware description language translate into the physical layout of the silicon chip.
## SKY L3 From software applications to Hardware

* Application Software (Top Left): Our journey begins with the software applications we use daily. These applications, written in languages like C++, Java, or Python, interact with the underlying system through a defined set of instructions.
* System Software and Compilation (Top): The Operating System (OS) acts as an intermediary, managing system resources and providing an interface for applications to interact with the hardware. Compilers translate high-level code (e.g., C++) into lower-level assembly language instructions specific to the target CPU architecture.
* Assembly and Machine Code (Middle): The Assembler further converts assembly code into binary machine code (0s and 1s) that the hardware can directly understand and execute. The * * * 
* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) serves as the abstract interface between software and hardware, defining the set of instructions a processor can execute.
* Hardware Implementation (Bottom): Register Transfer Level (RTL): This stage describes the hardware behavior using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL. RTL defines the flow of data between registers and the logical operations performed.
Netlist Synthesis: The RTL description is synthesized into a netlist, a detailed representation of the circuit's interconnected components (gates, flip-flops).

* Physical Design: Finally, the netlist guides the physical placement and routing of transistors and wires on the silicon die, resulting in the tangible hardware that executes the original software instructions.

Key Takeaways: This diagram highlights the layered abstraction involved in bridging the gap between software and hardware. It emphasizes the crucial role of compilers, assemblers, and hardware design tools in translating abstract instructions into physical circuits. Understanding this flow provides valuable insights into the relationship between software, hardware, and the underlying computer architecture.

## SKY L4 Introduction to OPENLANE and detailed ASIC designed flow

**Illustrates the comprehensive OpenLANE flow, encompassing design exploration, physical implementation, and sign-off. Key stages include:**

* **RTL Synthesis**: Converting Register Transfer Level (RTL) code into a gate-level netlist.
* **Floorplanning & Placement**: Planning the chip layout and placing standard cells.
* **CTS & Routing**: Clock Tree Synthesis and interconnecting placed cells with metal layers.
* **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**: Verifying timing closure.
* **Physical Verification**: Ensuring design rule compliance (DRC) and layout vs. schematic (LVS) correctness.
* **DFT(Design for Test)**: it perform scan inserption, automatic test pattern generation, Test patterns compaction, Fault coverage, Fault simulation.After that physical implementation is done by OpenROAD app
* **Static Timing analysis(STA)**: It involves the interconnect RC Extraction(DEF2SPEF) from the routed layout, followed by STA on OpenSTA(OpenROAD) tool. resulting report will shows the timing violations if any violations is there.
* **Physical Verification(DRC and LVS)**: Magic is used for design Rules checking and SPICE Extraction from Layout. Magic and Netgen are used for LVS.

Every time the netlist is modified.(CTS modifies the netlist and Post Placements optimization also modifies the netlist).So for that verification must be performed. The LCE(yosys) is used to formally confirm that the function did not change after modifying the netlist.

 **Dealing with antenna rules Violation**: When a metal wire segment is fabricated, it can act as antenna.As an antenna, it collect charges which can damaged the transister gates during the fabrication.
 ![Capture2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56658377-62ad-4058-9e61-d97f3c669b31)
 To address this issue, we have to limit the lenght of the wire. usually this is the job of the router. If router fails to do this, then there are two solutions: Bridging attaches a higher layer intermediary.Add antenna diode cell to leak away charges.(Antenna diodes are provided by the SCL)


![Screenshot 2024-07-13 150323](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfed294c-36d8-4de1-8daa-a4a1be766e52)

With OpenLANE, we took a preventive approach. here we add fake antenna diode next to every cell input after placement. Then run the Antenna checker on the routed layout. If the checker reports a violation on cell input pin, replace the fake diode cell by a real one.

**Commands to start Openlane using a docker and run synthesis**  
**After synthesis we have to calculate**  
**FLOP RATIO =** $\frac{\text{No of D flipflop}}{\text{Total Number of cells}}$  
**Percentage** = $\text{Flop Ratio} \times 100$
```bash
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
